# First, we need to find out the SCCs (col.1 in NEI) 
# of all coal combustion-related sources 
# I will use the package sqldf to retrieve that info from SCC_DF:
# After investigation, it seems that this information is located
# in the EI.Sector column in SCC_DF. So:

names(SCC_DF)[4] <- "EI_Sector" # sql doesn't like the original name (EI.Sector)

query_res <- sqldf("select SCC from SCC_DF where [EI_Sector] like '%Coal%'")

coal_SCCs <- as.character(query_res[["SCC"]]) # from query_res (DF) to characters vector

# now I can make the plot

               stat="summary", fun.y = "sum", # I plot the sum of emissions for each year
