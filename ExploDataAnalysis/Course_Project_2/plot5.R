# First, we need to find out the SCCs (col.1 in NEI) 
# of all motor vehicle sources 
# I will use the package sqldf to retrieve that info from SCC_DF:
# After investigation, it seems that this information is located
# in the EI.Sector column in SCC_DF. So:

names(SCC_DF)[4] <- "EI_Sector" # sql doesn't like the original name (EI.Sector)

query_res <- sqldf("select SCC from SCC_DF where EI_Sector like '%vehicle%'")

vehicle_SCCs <- as.character(query_res[["SCC"]]) # from query_res (DF) to characters vector

# now I can make the plot

vehicle_plot <- qplot(data = subset(NEI, (SCC %in% vehicle_SCCs) & 
                                        (fips == "24510")), 
                      x = year, y = Emissions,
                      stat="summary", fun.y = "sum") # I plot the sum of emissions for each year
