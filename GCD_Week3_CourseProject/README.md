You will find 3 files:

    - This README file
    - CookBook.md, which gives some details on the original and tidy data sets, and the steps used to produce the latter.
    - The script used to extract the tidy data set, named clean_data.R. To use the script as is:
        - Place it in the same directory as the 'UCI HAR Dataset' directory. If you don't, you will have to open the script and give the correct paths for the different files used
        - type `source("clean_data.R")`, and wait a little
        - tidy_data.txt has been created in your working directory (`getwd()`)
